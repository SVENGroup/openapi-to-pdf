## Requirements

- Node 20.18.x

## Linting

To lint JS/TS files run the following command:

```shell
npm run lint
```

The `npm run lint` command is part of a git pre-commit hook. Make sure you set git hooks as executable with:

```shell
chmod ug+x .githooks/pre-commit # for UNIX systems
```

## Formatting

This repository comes with a [.editorconfig](./.editorconfig) file to aid in formatting. This works with multiple IDEs but if you're using VSCode, make sure to install the [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig) plugin to make it work.

*Prettier was not installed since it currently has issues with keeping line breaks that developers often add for readability.*

## Testing

Execute the following command to run tests:

``` shell
npm run test
```
